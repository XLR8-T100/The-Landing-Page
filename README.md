*Nav Section*

The nav bar has a Logo named "XLR8" along with four links "Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact".

The nav has transitions on all links and uses flexbox to allow the items to align horizontally. 

When shrinking the screen the links overflow and leave the box, therfore the visability of 3/4 of the links are not visible.

to fix that you can either add more padding and margin, or the best way is adding media queries for smaller devices or dimensions.



*Hero Section*

Simple text welcoming guest in bold.

Below the welcome is a small sentence greeting and giving a little info about myself.

lastly theres a placeholder image to showcasing i can minipulate content inside a section.

The container has a background color that transitions into another, i added rounded borders for a more appealing look.

Everything is centered using flexbox for easy minipulation of items inside the container.

Footer has four peices of content including "Year, Privacy Policy, Terms Of Use, and Contacts".

Using flexbox to line content horizontaly.

Created an ul and li nested inside it, then used flexbox to align content/links horizontally.
